# CodeWars 2024

Questions for CodeWars 2024 in Bangkok, Thailand.

* Practice: `bknumerals`
* Qualifying: `dragon`
* Quarterfinals: `primes`, `maxsum`, `taxi`, `treesearch` - both teams over the
  time limit, resulting in a switch to `paperfold`
* Semifinals: `wordsearch`, `coins`
* Final: `flag`

## Credits

This is a cleaned-up repo. We removed other questions which were not asked
during the event, or that we didn't have time to sufficiently play-test.

Besides myself ([@ditsara](https://github.com/ditsara)), I had plenty of help
from:

* [@matthewmayer](https://github.com/matthewmayer) - play-testing and
  contributed several questions as well.
* [@Chomtana](https://github.com/Chomtana) - play-testing and Thai translations.

## For Future Use or Adaptation

* Write each question in a `question.md` markdown file. Include a YAML front 
  matter block with `answer: X`. Place it in a sub-folder corresponding to the 
  question name. Include any required support files, but not binaries; those 
  should be in the support folder.
* Answers go in solutions. There may be multiple solutions for different 
  languages. Use the same folder name as in questions.
* Any supporting code - e.g. for generating questions - goes in support.
